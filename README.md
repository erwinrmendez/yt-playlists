# YT Playlists Chrome Extension

**YT Playlists** allows for quick access to playlists from user's YouTube account.

This is a project in a series of tools that I am building, whether for daily use or just for the fun of learning something new.

## Features

- Requests to [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).
- Styling using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Caching playlists/videos with Local Storage.

This project uses a `REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_API_KEY` as environment variables. Since I have no intentions of publishing this app, [here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) is the link with instructions for setting up the credentials to use **OAuth 2.0** and obtaining the **YouTube Data API v3** key.

Here is a demo of the app.

## Let's chat!

I love learning new stuff, so any comments or suggestions are most welcomed.

Also, I love coffee. If you are around, we might try to do one those virtual coffee hangouts (it's totally a thing). Just hit me up!
