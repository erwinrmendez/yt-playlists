# YT Playlists Chrome Extension

**YT Playlists** allows for quick access to saved videos.

This is a project in a series of tools that I am building, whether for daily use or just for the fun of learning something new.

## Features

- Requests to YouTube API.
- Styling using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Caching playlists/videos with Local Storage.

You can watch a demo of the app [here]().

## Let's chat!

I love learning new stuff, so any comments or suggestions are most welcomed.

Also, I love coffee. If you are around, we might try to do one those virtual coffee hangouts (it's totally a thing). Just hit me up!
